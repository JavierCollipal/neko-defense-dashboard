# Answer the prompts:
# - Set up and deploy? N (no)
# - Link to existing project? N (no, create new)
# - Project name? neko-defense-dashboard
# - Directory? ./ (current directory)

# This creates .vercel/project.json with your IDs!

- **Secret:** `https://neko-api.up.railway.app` (change after Railway deployment)

**NEXT_PUBLIC_GRAPHQL_URL:**

## üß™ TEST YOUR SECRETS

After adding all secrets, verify them:

2. You should see 5-7 secrets listed (names only, values hidden)
3. They should NOT show any expiration warnings

## üöÄ READY TO DEPLOY?

Once you have **AT LEAST** these 5 secrets:
- ‚úÖ MONGODB_URI
- ‚úÖ VERCEL_TOKEN
- ‚úÖ VERCEL_ORG_ID
- ‚úÖ VERCEL_PROJECT_ID
- ‚úÖ RAILWAY_TOKEN

**You're ready to push and trigger the CI/CD pipeline!**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add CI/CD pipeline with smart CORS"
git push origin main

# Then watch your deployment at:
# https://github.com/JavierCollipal/neko-defense-dashboard/actions
```

---

## üÜò TROUBLESHOOTING

**Problem: Can't find Settings tab**
- Make sure you're the repository owner or have admin access
- Personal repos always have Settings tab

**Problem: Vercel token creation fails**
- Make sure you're logged into Vercel
- Try a different browser if issues persist

**Problem: Railway requires credit card**
- Railway gives $5 free credit per month
- You won't be charged unless you exceed the free tier
- Can add credit card for validation only

**Problem: .vercel/project.json doesn't exist**
- Make sure you ran `vercel link` in the correct directory
- Try `vercel --cwd /home/wakibaka/Documents/github/neko-defense-dashboard link`
